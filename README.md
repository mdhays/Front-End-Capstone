# Front end capstone
## Run Run Skeleton

Run Run Skeleton is an infinite runner made as my front end capstone at Nashville Software School. The object is to last as long as you can against the onslaught of tombstones. 

#Technologies
- Javascript
- Phaser
- Jade
- Node.js
- Express
- Heroku

Node.js and Express were added in after my original presentation to allow the game to be hosted on Heroku. I changed over the HTML to Jade because I prefer it and it works well with Node and Express. This project was a major milestone for me because I had to learn Phaser on my own, and it was the first time I attempted to learn a framework by myself. I gained a lot of confidence from making this game and it's now available to play at http://sleepy-beach-81112.herokuapp.com.

## Goals for version 2.0
- Options such as mute and pause buttons.
- Saving scores to a database and adding a leaderboard.
